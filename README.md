# Improving Extreme Weather Forecasts using AI




### The Problem

In this project, the team will model data to predict the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum temperature over the next 14 days for each location and start date for longer-term weather forecasting to help communities adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

Various Machine Learning methods can be used to make these predictions, such as Random Forests, XGBoost, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The team will explore several choices.

Data can be augmented with meteorological data such as temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  

One of the key challenges will be to choose a subset of appropriate features that impact a weather forecastâ€™s predictions to be used in model training.


### The Goals

The goals of this challenge are: 

* Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis
* Preprocessing 
* Feature Extraction
* Model(s) Development and Training
* Evaluate the best Model
